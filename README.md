# Blue_Pill_USB_HID_Example
<p align = "justify"> This is an example of USB HID on Blue Pill using STM32CubeIDE. This is the project I used to create an analog handbrake and sequential shifter for PC racing games. I designed the mechanical parts in Fusion 360 and 3D printed them. Then I assembled the device using the printed parts, screws and springs. The end result is presented with the pictures below. This device was my first prototype, so there could still be a lot to improve, especially in the 3D design to make it look more appealing and easier to assemble for example. </p>
